# Movie Explorer

Movie Explorer is a simple iOS app built with Swift that allows users to discover trending movies, view detailed information about each movie, and save their favorite movies. This project was developed as a personal learning experience to practice Swift, UIKit, and programmatic UI.

## Usage
- Explore trending movies by navigating through the first tab. 
- Tap on any movie poster to see more details.
- Use the "Favorite" button to save movies that you want to keep track of.

## Features
- **Trending Movies:** The first tab fetches and displays trending movies from TMDB (The Movie Database). Users can browse through the list of trending movies.
- **Movie Details:** When a user taps on a movie poster, they are navigated to a details screen that fetches and displays additional information about the selected movie.
- **Favorites:** Users can save their favorite movies, which are accessible across app sessions.

## Approach
- **Language:** Swift
- **UI Framework:** UIKit
- **API:** The Movie Database (TMDB) API
- **UI Approach:** Programmatic UI

## Purpose
This app was created as a part of my journey to learn Swift and iOS development. The goal was to build an app independently, without relying on external help, and to deepen my understanding of UIKit and API integration in iOS.
